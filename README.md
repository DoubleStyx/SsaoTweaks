# SsaoTweaks

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that allows the individual parameters of the SSAO effect to be configured. The [NeosModSettings](https://github.com/badhaloninja/NeosModSettings) mod is recommended as it will allow you to tweak the values while Neos is running. An explanation of all the ssao settings can be found [here](https://wiki.amplify.pt/index.php?title=Unity_Products:Amplify_Occlusion/Manual#Ambient_Occlusion_Control).
## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [ModNameGoesHere.dll](https://github.com/GithubUsername/RepoName/releases/latest/download/ModNameGoesHere.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
